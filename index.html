                <p>Dawn on the Ganges is a fabulous sight. The river flows south to north, with the city on the west
                    bank, and fields and trees to the east. As the sun rises, the golden rays fall on the innumerable
                    temples and 70 bathing ghats, on the priests under their tilted umbrellas, and devout Hindus taking
                    a purifying dip. The one notable mosque on the skyline was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.
                    Rowing boats take visitors along the ghats from Assi in the north to Raj Ghat, a highly recommended
                    experience. Within the city itself, the Vishvanath Temple is a major attraction, as is the Sankat
                    Mochan shrine. </p>

                    The holy river Ganges flows south to north, with the city on the west bank, and fields and trees to
                    the east. Dawn is the best time to venture on to the water. Rowing boats take visitors from Assi in
                    the north to Raj Ghat â€“ a highly recommended experience. As the sun rises, the golden rays
                    illuminate countless temples and 70 bathing ghats, priests plying their trade under tilted
                    umbrellas, and devout Hindus taking a purifying dip. </p>
